When thinking about how to better visualize the parallel between the human body and the ocean, in particular the parallel between the damages that we ourselves inflict upon us and the damages we, as a species, inflict upon the oceans, we started with the obvious ideas of trying to talk about the harmful effects of our actions as individuals. Early on in our brainstorming we realized, however, that it's really not about the individual, but about the collective.

Everybody should of course be encouraged to do their part in reducing their impact on the environment, but the real change has to come from the top. The shift in blame to the consumers has enabled big corporations and governments to get away scot-free.

Our mini-game is proposed then as a *provocation*, every choice you make will actually converge to the same result, the only way to win is to not play. This message feels a bit nihilistic, but it's a reflection of the reality we live in. The parallel of the damages on our body and the damages on the ocean is represented graphically.

We think there is still hope, but the real way to make a change is by trying to get these problems to the forefront of the political agenda. We need to make sure that the people in power are held accountable for their actions, and that they are forced to make the necessary changes to protect our planet.
